					<h2 id="abTag" >CONNECTING PEOPLE WITH SCIENCE AND NATURE</h2>
					<p>
						These days, not only are we more disconnected to nature than ever, but more is known about it than ever before. How many of us can confidently identify the native trees in our area, while on the other hand scientists have mapped and studied tens of thousands of genes in flowering plants alone. My work seeks to make science and nature both accessible and exciting, through the use of illustrations and data driven graphics. This work can be traditional, digital, or even interactive, and can be suitable for a wide variety of media, from publications to museum displays.
						<br><br>
						Like my work, my background is very multidisciplinary. I have extensive biological and data science knowledgeable, with degrees in Plant Sciences (BSc Hons) and Bioinformatics (MSc) from the University of Edinburgh. Projects from these degrees include generating and analysing next generation sequencing data pertaining to plant development, and designing and building a private genomics website and database for the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. I have traditional training in botanical illustration, with a Certificate in Botanical Illustration (with distinction) from the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Additionally, I have thorough training as a fine art printmaker, including an internship at Wingate Studio, and am proficient at using industry standard tools for graphic design, including Adobe suite programs.
